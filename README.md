# SALURhelper


## Overview

The *Salud Urbana en America Latina* (SALURBAL) research project and
itâ€™s successor, SALURBAL-Climate, are focused understanding health in
urban Latin America. Many of these papers use similar statistical
methods. This package provides a centralized location for common helper
functions used in such research.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("SALURBAL-Climate/SALURhelper")
library(SALURhelper)
```

## Usage

To get the QAIC of a quasi-Poisson model, use the `QAIC` function on the
model output.

``` r
fit <- glm(hp ~ mpg + disp + wt, family = "quasipoisson", data = mtcars)
stats::AIC(fit)
```

    [1] NA

``` r
SALURhelper::QAIC(fit)
```
